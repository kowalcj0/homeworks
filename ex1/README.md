Exercise 1
----------

#Requirements

* python 2.7+ or 3.x
* pip (Python Package Index)
* virtualenvwrapper


## pip

Get `pip` by following the instructions
[here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12476379)


## virtualenvwrapper

Once you have `pip` installed then install
[virtualenvwrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper) which is a
set of extensions to Ian Bickingâ€™s virtualenv tool. The extensions include
wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise managing
your development workflow, making it easier to work on more than one project at
a time without introducing conflicts in their dependencies.

```bash
jk@comp: $ pip install virtualenvwrapper==4.7.2
```

# Virtual environment

To create a new virtual environment simply issue:

```bash
jk@comp: $ mkvirtualenv ex1
```

Once the virtual environment was created successfully, you should see its name
at the beginning of the prompt line, e.g.:

```bash
(ex1) jk@comp: $
```

# Dependencies

This project has following dependencies:

* [behave](http://pythonhosted.org/behave/tutorial.html) - BDD Python style.
* [requests](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests) - Python HTTP for Humans.

Once you have `virtualenv` ready to go, we can then install the dependencies:

```bash
(ex1) jk@comp: $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running tests

To run all tests simply run `behave` command:

```bash
(ex1) jk@comp: $ behave
```
